### Winning Project Solution for Problem Statement : (GS910) Using Innovative Blockchain Technologies in Emergency Management and Disaster Response

### Description : 
The NDRF relays on a lot of data to quickly action during the time of disaster. Current limitations are that there is no one common platform / integrated or adaptable for futuristic needs. Blockchain is one suitable technology which is secure, distributed, and immutable digital ledger that records transactions. Using blockchain in emergency management can provide interoperability between many parties involved in response and provide transparency. Some requirements are A common platform, Immutable data, Secure sharing & management, Demand reporting, improve trust with 3rd party verification, Tracking and visibility, Honoring volunteer effort, Future Tokenization.A blockchain solution seems to be of much use to address the challenges in disaster response mechanism. 

Examples include the following: 
- A common platform: Blockchain brings collaboration and coordination among all stakeholders involved in relief effort by having a single, trusted ledger. 
- Immutable data: Once data is recorded, it cannot be easily changed, creating an audit trail and trusted system for collection and distribution of goods and services. 
- Secure sharing & management: Documents and personally identifiable information (PII) can be securely managed and shared with need-to-know parties. This enables compliance with privacy regulations across different geographic regions. 
- Demand reporting: Demand (needs) from different areas can be recorded on a single network by trusted participants and met by different agencies. This can avoid duplication and wastage. 
- Improve trust with 3rd party verification: Needs can be verified by 3rd parties to increase the trust. 
- Tracking and visibility: Inventory of supplies can be tracked from receipt into the warehouses until delivery to the end receiver. This improves transparency and facilitates logistics, leading to faster responses and avoidance of duplication of efforts across relief organizations. 
- Honoring volunteer effort: Volunteers hours can be captured, tracked, rewarded, and audited. Incentives, even if just recognition, can lead to more community engagement. 
- Future Tokenization: Potential future tokenization and linkage to stable coin can be used to incentivize volunteers to help.
